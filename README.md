# Surveyform
A simple survey form in HTML/CSS to collect data around crisp flavours
This form has text boxes, number boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes and free form boxes
This is intended to be used by a marketing company to collect data around individuals favourite crisp flavours
It uses solely HTML & CSS
I would like to connect the reponses to a database and run some analytics (but don't have the knowledge to do that yet)
Review the code, design and functionality and let me know what you think
